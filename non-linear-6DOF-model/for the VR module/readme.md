# Running the Simulation
## Steps 
	1. Run the RunFirstLongitudinalModel.m and RunFirstLateralModel.m files in MATLAB.
	2. Save the variables in your workspace in matlab type just in case. 
	3. Run the RunSecond_initCode.m to load the initial conditions. 
	4. Connect the joystick to the computer. 
	4. Open the SimuLink model and check if the joystick is connected to the proper port. 
	6. open the function file NonLinSixDOFModel.m and make changes to the parameters according to the aircraft.
	5. Run the SimuLink model
